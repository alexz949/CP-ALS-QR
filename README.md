# CP-ALS-QR
This repository contains MATLAB codes for CP tensor decompositions that use the more stable 
QR decomposition for problems with ill-conditioning. 

This code accompanies the paper

Rachel Minster, Irina Viviano, Xiaotian Liu, and Grey Ballard. "CP Decomposition for Tensors 
via Alternating Least Squares with QR Decomposition." Submitted, 2021

# Toolbox requirements
This code requires two tensor packages for MATLAB, Tensor Toolbox and Tensorlab.
